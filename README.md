### Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.

## Stackbit

This theme is ready to import into Stackbit. It can be deployed to Netlify and you can connect any headless CMS including Forestry, NetlifyCMS, DatoCMS, Sanity or Contentful.

### Posts

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the \_posts directory by following the [recommended file structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files).

      ---
      layout: post
      title: "Welcome to Jekyll!"
      date: 2018-08-23 16:04:00 +0300
      image: 03.jpg
      tags: Jekyll
      ---


You can set the tags and the post image.

Add post images to **/images/** directory.

For tags, try to not add space between two words, for example, `Ruby on Rails`, could be something like (`ruby-on-rails`, `Ruby_on_Rails`, or `Ruby-on-Rails`).

### Disqus Comments

Reked Theme comes with Disqus comments enabled.

Open `_config.yml` file, and change the `mr-brown` value on line 30 with your [Disqus account shortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

      Comment Section (Disqus)
      disqus-identifier: mr-brown # Add your shortname for Disqus Comment. For example mr-brown


That’s all you need to setup Disqus from the theme side. If you get any issue regarding that comments are unable to load. First, make sure you have [registered your website with Disqus (Step 1)](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466182-publisher-quick-start-guide).

And also check [Disqus troubleshooting guide](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22) if you still have issues.

* * *

### Google Analytics

To integrate Google Analytics, open `_config.yml`, and add your Google Analytics identifier.

    # Google Analytics
    google-analytics: \# Add your identifier. For example UA-99631805-1


* * *

### Update favicon

You can find the current favicon (favicon.ico) inside the theme root directory, just replace it with your new favicon.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jaclynxu/jaclynxu.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jaclynxu/jaclynxu.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
